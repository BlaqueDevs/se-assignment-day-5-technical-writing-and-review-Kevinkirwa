## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
Understanding your audience's expertise helps you choose simpler language for beginners and more detailed terms for experts, so everyone can understand.
## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
Strategies include using plain language, giving more examples for beginners, and including detailed explanations or references for experts.

To ensure accessibility, use simple words, avoid complex terms, explain concepts in steps, and add a glossary.
## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
Plain language is important because it makes information clear and easy to read for everyone, not just tech experts.

Examples of simplifying terms: Use "start" instead of "initiate" or "help" instead of "assist," making it easier to understand.
